# Active-learning
Here, we compare active learning vs passive learning using CNN models and diffrenet AL strategies.

# Datasets:

1. Minst Fashion Dataset 
2. CIFAR-10 Dataset
3. Imbalanced Minst Fashion Dataset 


# AL Strategies:


1. Random Sampling
2. Entropy sampling
3. Margin sampling
4. Uncertainty sampling (Least Confidence Sampling)
